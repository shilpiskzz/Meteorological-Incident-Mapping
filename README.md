# Indian Incident Portal
This dashboard harmonizes geospatial intelligence, real-time filtering, and data visualization into a single interactive interface. Built with React, Tailwind, and Recharts, and powered by GeoJSON maps, it transforms raw incident data into actionable insights. While inspired by Nepal’s Bipad Portal, this solution is fully customized for Indian data and user needs—offering a lightweight, highly visual disaster response tool.
