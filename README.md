# Indian Incident Portal
This dashboard harmonizes geospatial intelligence, real-time filtering, and data visualization into a single interactive interface. Built with React, Tailwind, and Recharts, and powered by GeoJSON maps, it transforms raw incident data into actionable insights. While inspired by Nepalâ€™s Bipad Portal, this solution is fully customized for Indian data and user needsâ€”offering a lightweight, highly visual disaster response tool.
